polopoly-dsl
============

My XText-based project for a Eclipse plugin that defines a dsl with an editor for Polopoly content in the text format.

### Prerequisites
This project uses:
* Eclipse
* XText: http://www.eclipse.org/xtext/
* Xtend: http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/

## Overview
There are three projects:
1. The core project: com.polopoly.ps.dsl.textcontent
2. The tests: com.polopoly.ps.dsl.textcontent.tests
3. The UI part: com.polopoly.ps.dsl.textcontent.ui
This structure is generated by the text 'New Project' wizard.

Most of the files are generated by the Eclipse Model Workflow. To define the grammar for the dsl there is actually only one file to edit: TextContent.xtext (and the test for it of course: TextContentDslTest.xtend). The code generation is triggered by doing 'Run as' -> MWE2 Workflow on the GenerateTextContent.mwe2 file. There is also a shortcut for this by right-clicking in the editor of the grammar definition file.
